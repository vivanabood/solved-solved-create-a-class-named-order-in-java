<br>
Create a class named Order that performs order processing of a single item. The class has the following five fields:

Customer name

Customer number

Quantity ordered

Unit price

Total price

Include set and get methods for each field except the total price field. The set methods prompt the user for values for each field. This class also needs a method to compute the total price (quantity times unit price) and a method to display the field values.

Create a subclass named ShippedOrder that overrides computePrice() by adding a shipping and handling charge of $4.00. Write an application named UseOrder that instantiates an object of each of these classes. Prompt the user for data for the Order object, and display the results, then prompt the user for data for the ShippedOrder object, and display the results.0
